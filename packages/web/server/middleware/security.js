/*
 * Content Security Policy (CSP)
 *
 * - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
 *    Malicious JS is put on the page, which can steal sensitive data or perform
 *    malicious actions
 * - XSS Filter
 *    A unique kind of XSS where a script is placed into a URLs query parameters.
 *    This script will then be ran by the browser. @see https://helmetjs.github.io/docs/xss-filter/
 * - Clickjacking
 *    This is where your website will run inside an iframe in order to run on top of some secret
 *    content. This could mean that when you click a button, you're actually clicking something
 *    underneath the iframe. @see https://helmetjs.github.io/docs/frameguard/
 * - MIME Sniffing
 *    Some browsers will try to "guess" the content type of the files. If an image was uploaded with a
 *    .jpg extension, but its contents were actually HTML, then someone visiting that image could cause
 *    the browser to "run" the HTML, which could also contain malicious JavaScript.
 *    @see https://helmetjs.github.io/docs/dont-sniff-mimetype/
 * - Put a tiny image on your site (tracking pixel)
 *    Puts a tiny image on your site to gain an idea of how much traffic your site gets
 * - Get a vulnerable plugin to run
 *    Exploit its flaws while on your website
 * -
 *
 * So, CSP?
 * A CSP will define exactly where your site can download different types of resources from.
 *
 * What if I want to include a `<script>` tag?
 * We can "sign" our scripts with a nonce tag which looks something like this:
 * `<script nonce="nonce-614d9122-d5b0-4760-aecf-3a5d17cf0ac9">....</script>`
 * This security middleware will generate a nonce and attach it to `response`, passing it onto the
 * React middleware.
